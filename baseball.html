          Baseball has two teams of 9 players.
        </li>
        <li>
          The fielding teamâ€™s positions are made up of a pitcher, catcher, first baseman, second baseman, shortstop, third baseman, and three outfielders at left field, center field and right field.
        </li>
        <li>
          Games last for 9 innings of which both teams get to bat once. If the game is a tie after 9 innings then an extra inning will be added until a winner is found. If the team batting second in the bottom of the 9th inning are already ahead in points, then they do not need to complete their batting innings.
        </li>
